# Library Book Tracker

This is a small Java command-line project for tracking:

- books
- borrowers
- checkout and return status

It is intentionally small and beginner-friendly:

- plain Java only
- no frameworks
- simple OOP structure
- local file storage
- clear separation between UI, business logic, models, and persistence

## 1. Project Overview

The app starts, loads saved data from disk, and shows a text menu in a loop.

From the menu, a user can:

- add a book
- list all books
- register a borrower
- list all borrowers
- check out a book
- return a book
- view checked-out books
- save data manually
- exit the program

When the program exits, it saves automatically.

## 2. Project Structure

```text
src/
  librarytracker/
    App.java
    model/
      Book.java
      Borrower.java
    service/
      LibraryManager.java
    storage/
      FileStorage.java
```

The `data` folder is created automatically the first time the app saves or loads data.

## 3. How To Compile And Run

Use Java 17 or newer.

From the project root in PowerShell:

```powershell
javac -d out src\librarytracker\App.java src\librarytracker\model\Book.java src\librarytracker\model\Borrower.java src\librarytracker\service\LibraryManager.java src\librarytracker\storage\FileStorage.java
java -cp out librarytracker.App
```

## 4. File-By-File Explanation

### `src/librarytracker/App.java`

This is the command-line interface.

Responsibilities:

- start the program
- create the storage and manager objects
- show the menu
- read user input
- call the manager
- print results

### `src/librarytracker/model/Book.java`

This class represents one book.

It stores:

- book identity
- title and author
- optional ISBN
- whether it is checked out
- who borrowed it
- when it was checked out
- when it is due

### `src/librarytracker/model/Borrower.java`

This class represents one borrower.

It stores:

- borrower identity
- name
- optional email
- optional phone

### `src/librarytracker/service/LibraryManager.java`

This is the business logic layer.

It is responsible for:

- managing the in-memory lists of books and borrowers
- creating stable unique IDs
- checking whether a book or borrower exists
- enforcing checkout and return rules
- saving the current data through the storage class

### `src/librarytracker/storage/FileStorage.java`

This is the persistence layer.

It is responsible for:

- loading books from disk
- loading borrowers from disk
- saving books to disk
- saving borrowers to disk
- creating the `data` directory if needed

## 5. Class-By-Class Explanation

### `App`

Purpose:

- user interaction

Important idea:

- this class should ask questions and show results, not decide the library rules

### `Book`

Purpose:

- represent one book and its current checkout state

Important idea:

- the book object knows whether it is checked out and stores the borrower ID when it is borrowed

### `Borrower`

Purpose:

- represent one person who can borrow books

Important idea:

- this class is mostly a simple data container

### `LibraryManager`

Purpose:

- central place for business rules

Important idea:

- keeping the rules here prevents the UI from becoming messy

### `FileStorage`

Purpose:

- read and write text files

Important idea:

- file handling stays separate from the rest of the program

### `FileStorage.LibraryData`

- small helper class used to return both book and borrower lists together

## 7. How Books And Borrowers Relate To Each Other

A `Book` does not store the full `Borrower` object.

Instead, it stores only:

- `borrowerId`

That means:

- the book keeps a reference to the borrower by ID
- the manager can look up the full borrower later
- this keeps the model simple and avoids tightly coupling the two classes

This is a very common beginner-friendly pattern:

- one object stores another object's ID
- a manager or service class connects them when needed

## 8. How Checkout And Return Flows Work

### Checkout flow

1. The user chooses the checkout menu option.
2. The app reads the book ID.
3. The app reads the borrower ID.
4. The app reads an optional due date.
5. `LibraryManager.checkOutBook` checks that the book exists.
6. It checks that the borrower exists.
7. It checks that the book is not already checked out.
8. If valid, the book is updated with borrower ID, checkout date, and due date.

### Return flow

1. The user chooses the return menu option.
2. The app reads the book ID.
3. `LibraryManager.returnBook` checks that the book exists.
4. It checks that the book is currently checked out.
5. If valid, `Book.returnBook` clears the checkout fields.

## 9. How Saving And Loading Work

### On startup

- `App.main` creates `FileStorage`
- `LibraryManager` calls `fileStorage.load()`
- if files exist, data is rebuilt into objects
- if files do not exist, empty lists are used

### On save

- `LibraryManager.saveData` calls `FileStorage.save`
- books are written to `data/books.txt`
- borrowers are written to `data/borrowers.txt`

### File format

The saved files use a simple record format:

```text
id=0
title=Clean Code
author=Robert C. Martin
isbn=9780132350884
checkedOut=true
borrowerId=0
checkedOutAt=2026-03-26
dueDate=2026-04-05
---
```

This format is easy to inspect by hand and easier for a beginner to understand than binary serialization.

## 10. Why The Project Was Structured This Way

This project uses a small number of classes with clear jobs:

- `App` handles input and output
- `Book` and `Borrower` hold domain data
- `LibraryManager` handles rules
- `FileStorage` handles saving and loading

This structure is useful because it avoids:

- one giant `main` method
- duplicated rule checks in many places
- mixing file code with menu code

It stays small enough for a beginner to read fully.

## 11. What A Beginner Should Study First

Study the project in this order:

1. `Book`
2. `Borrower`
3. `LibraryManager`
4. `App`
5. `FileStorage`

Why this order works:

- first understand the data
- then understand the business rules
- then understand how the user interacts with the rules
- finally understand persistence

Java topics worth studying while reading this project:

- classes and objects
- constructors
- fields and getters
- lists
- loops
- conditionals
- `Optional`
- `LocalDate`
- file reading and writing

## 12. Three Small Exercises To Extend The Project

1. Add a search option that finds books by title or author.

2. Add a default due date of 14 days when the user leaves the due date blank.

3. Show how many books each borrower currently has checked out.

## 13. Final Beginner Advice

Try reading the code in small passes instead of all at once:

1. Read the model classes.
2. Trace one feature, such as adding a book.
3. Trace one rule, such as checking out a book.
4. Trace saving and loading last.

This project is intentionally simple. The goal is not to build the most advanced library system. The goal is to build a version that teaches solid Java fundamentals without hiding the logic behind frameworks or advanced patterns.
